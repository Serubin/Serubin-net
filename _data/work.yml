  desc: "MIT Lincoln Lab is a government funded research facility where I worked within the Space Systems & Technology Group. Lincoln Lab provided me with an opportunity to step into cutting edge technical research at a very young age and gave me direct control over portions of the projects I worked on. Projects such as the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project allowed me to work on challenging problems that required innovative solutions. I was able to explore a plethora of topics that I would not have otherwise access to such as machine learning, image processing, parallel computing on supercomputers, and many other areas."
