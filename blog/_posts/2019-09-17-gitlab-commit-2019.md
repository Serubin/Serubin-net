## Abstract
Every day, the federal government tackles some of the most difficult challenges that we face as a society. From defending the country itself to ensuring law enforcement's ability to protect citizens.
<!--excerpt_end-->
Inevitability, at the core of all of these challenges, is code.

In this talk, Solomon will take a brief look into how the federal government tackles these challenges on a daily basis including how it's evolving: how it contributes to and develops open-source, how it utilizes Innersource within and across individual agencies, and of course, how Gitlab sits at the middle of all of this.
