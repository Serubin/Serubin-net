## Abstract
Every day, the federal government tackles some of the most difficult challenges that we face as a society. From defending the country itself to ensuring law enforcement's ability to protect citizens.
<!--excerpt_end-->
Inevitably, at the core of all of these challenges, is code.

In this talk, Solomon will take a brief look into how the federal government tackles these challenges on a daily basis including how it's evolving: how it contributes to and develops open-source, how it utilizes Innersource within and across individual agencies, and of course, how GitLab sits at the middle of all of this.

Over the course of his career, he has worked on a variety of cyber defense projects which have enabled advanced asteroid detection, enhanced defense against cybercriminals, and more. He has promoted the use of Open Source and InnerSource within both MITRE and United States government projects.
